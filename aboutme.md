Currently, I am a graduate student at Texas A&M in the second year of my Master's program. My research interests are focused on fire ecology, and the effects of fire on ecosystems in the Great Plains of the US. My current projects include using habitat modelling to predict wildland fires, studying the effects of climate change on wildland fires in the Southern Great Plains, and building a dendrichronological record for Ashe Juniper in the Texas Hill country. 


### my history

I graduated with a BS in Spatial Science in 2014 from Texas A&M University. My academic background is based promarily on GIS and Remote Sensing, with parallel interests in land management and forestry. 

Outside of academia, I help work on and manage a family ranch in central Texas. Recently I have also been helping work on prescribed burns with the Hamilton County chapter of the Edwards Plateau Prescribed Burn Association.
