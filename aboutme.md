Currently, I am a graduate student at Texas A&M in the second year of my Master's program. My research interests are focused on fire ecology, and the effects of fire on ecosystems in the Great Plains of the US. My current projects include using habitat modelling to predict wildland fires, studying the effects of climate change on wildland fires in the Southern Great Plains, and building a dendrichronological record for Ashe Juniper in the Texas Hill country. 


### My History

I graduated with a BS in Spatial Science in 2014 from Texas A&M University. My academic background is based promarily on GIS and Remote Sensing, with parallel interests in land management and forestry. 

Outside of academia, I help work on and manage a family ranch in central Texas. Recently I have also been helping work on prescribed burns with the Hamilton County chapter of the Edwards Plateau Prescribed Burn Association. 


### My Research

# Wildland Fire in the High Plains

   Within the United States and the State of Texas, wildland fires are often perceived as a means of habitat and property destruction. However, wildland fires are also often responsible for maintaining ecosystems and driving species composition in grasslands, forests and shrublands. As a natural means of disturbance in many landscapes, it is important to identify what landscape features are responsible for promoting the spread and ignition of wildfires. Within this context, my research is focused on the modeling of the spatial interactions between wildfires and the influence of geography, climate, ecology and human development across many scales and regions. I seek to address questions such as how climate change will effect wildfire numbers and size, as well as how human and ecological changes can contribute to sudden increases or decreases in fire occurrence. To do this, I utilize remote sensing, Geographic Information Systems, and public data to develop open-source tools and techniques to best allow landowners, urban planners, and policymakers to make educated decisions in policy and land use.

# Using Maximum Entropy Modeling to Predict Wildland Fire Occurrence

   Much of my current research is focused on using Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) models to predict wildland fire occurrence. Originally built to predict habitats, I use it to better understand how climate, geography, ecology and humans impact wildland fire occurrence. By improving our understanding of landscape characteristics which are indicative of wildland fire occurrence, we can better create predictive models to anticipate fire danger across wide areas.

# Using Plant Phytoliths to Characterize Paleofires

   Plant phytoliths, small silica structures that form within plant cell structures, are persistent records of the vegetation that existed over time. Whether it's grasses from the Eocene or from two months ago, they can give us information on the types of vegetation present. In addition, they can serve as indicators of fire presence in an area. I want to explore how fires burned during the varying climatic conditions in the past. I also am interested in using plant phytoliths to identify fire regimes in the Great Plains of the United States, where other fire records may not have been preserved over time.


# Prescribed Burning

   Prescribed burning is an increasing important tool in a land manager's prescription for a property. Whether it be improving grazinglands for cattle, controlling woody vegetation, or opening up the understory of forests, prescribed burning is a versatile application of disturbance ecology for landowner use. I am interested in how we can best develop this tool to achieve landowner goals and objectives.
