I am a graduate student at Michigan State University working on my PhD in Forestry and Ecology Evolutionary Biology & Behavior. I work in Dr. Jessica Miesel's  Fire and Ecosystem Ecology lab studying fire effects on soil chemistry. My current projects are using plant phytoliths as historical records of fire occurrence.

## My Research

### Wildland Fire in the US Great Plains

   Within the United States and the State of Texas, wildland fires are often perceived as a means of habitat and property destruction. However, wildland fires are also often responsible for maintaining ecosystems and driving species composition in grasslands, forests and shrublands. As a natural means of disturbance in many landscapes, it is important to identify what landscape features are responsible for promoting the spread and ignition of wildfires. Within this context, my research is focused on the modeling of the spatial interactions between wildfires and the influence of geography, climate, ecology and human development across many scales and regions. I seek to address questions such as how climate change will effect wildfire numbers and size, as well as how human and ecological changes can contribute to sudden increases or decreases in fire occurrence. To do this, I utilize remote sensing, Geographic Information Systems, and public data to develop open-source tools and techniques to best allow landowners, urban planners, and policymakers to make educated decisions in policy and land use.

### Using Species Distribution Models to Predict Wildland Fire Occurrence

   One of my current research interests is in the use of Specides Distribution Models (SDMs) to predict wildland fire occurrence. Originally built to predict habitats, I use it to better understand how climate, geography, ecology and humans impact wildland fire occurrence. By improving our understanding of landscape characteristics which are indicative of wildland fire occurrence, we can better create predictive models to anticipate fire danger across wide areas.

### Using Plant Phytoliths to Characterize Paleofires

   Plant phytoliths, small silica structures that form within plant cell structures, are persistent records of the vegetation that existed over time. Whether it's grasses from the Eocene or from two months ago, they can give us information on the types of vegetation present. In addition, they can serve as indicators of fire presence in an area. I want to explore how fires burned during the varying climatic conditions in the past. I also am interested in using plant phytoliths to identify fire regimes in the Great Plains of the United States, where other fire records may not have been preserved over time.


### Prescribed Burning

   Prescribed burning is an increasing important tool in a land manager's prescription for a property. Whether it be improving grazinglands for cattle, controlling woody vegetation, or opening up the understory of forests, prescribed burning is a versatile application of disturbance ecology for landowner use. I am interested in how we can best develop this tool to achieve landowner goals and objectives.
