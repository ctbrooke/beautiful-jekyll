title: Conferences & Traveling

## Traveling is exhausting!

This has been a crazy fall of traveling. In the excitement of making progress and getting results from my thesis research this past summer, I was beyond excited to start submitting abstracts to conferences and such throughout the fall. Now that I am attending the final couple weeks of the fall semester, I look back and am quite stunned about how much I pushed myself traveling the past few months. Overall, I managed to squeeze 2 conferences, 1 symposium, and an invited talk into a little over 3 months. I am extremely motivated by the interest my research has garnered in these travels, though I think that I will try to tone down the busyness in the future. 


Now, as I am in the throes of traveling to the 3rd Fire Ecology Conference in Tuscon, AZ I have found that all this experience has given me a really good perspective on my research in wildland fire modeling. Discussing this work with others embodies what I beleive to be one of the key tenets of science: communication. In talking with various groups, I find that there is a great amount to learn from others. 

In any case, this trip should prove very interesting both in learning about current issues and trends in wildland fire science, but should also be a good learning experience.
