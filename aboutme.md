I am a graduate student at Michigan State University working on my PhD in Forestry and Ecology Evolutionary Biology & Behavior. I work in Dr. Jessica Miesel's  Fire and Ecosystem Ecology lab studying fire effects on soil chemistry. My current projects are using plant phytoliths as historical records of fire occurrence.

## My Research

### Using Plant Phytoliths to Characterize Paleofires

   Plant phytoliths, small silica structures that form within plant cell structures, are persistent records of the vegetation that existed over time. Whether it's grasses from the Eocene or from two months ago, they can give us information on the types of vegetation present. In addition, they can serve as indicators of fire presence in an area. I want to explore how fires burned during the varying climatic conditions in the past. I also am interested in using plant phytoliths to identify fire regimes in the Great Plains of the United States, where other fire records may not have been preserved over time.


### Prescribed Burning and juniper management

   The rangelands and savannas of Texas are increasingly being encrached upon by native juniper species. This has resulted in a gradual reduction of open grasslands and has consequently changed the structure and composition of these ecosystems. However, prescribed fire has been successfully used to combat this incrachment via removing oldgrowth juniper and preventing the establishment of new juniper. I am working with the Cross Timbers Prescribed Burn Association and Texas A&M Agrilife to determine best fire management practices and provide information to landowners interested in prescribed burning. 


### Using Species Distribution Models to Predict Wildland Fire Occurrence

   Much of my previous work was in the use of Specides Distribution Models (SDMs) to predict wildland fire occurrence. Originally built to predict habitats, I used it to better understand how climate, geography, ecology and humans impact wildland fire occurrence. By improving our understanding of landscape characteristics which are indicative of wildland fire occurrence, we can better create predictive models to anticipate fire danger across wide areas.
